## üí° Project Idea

We propose a blockchain-based order verification system that ensures tracking numbers are cryptographically linked to actual orders which can also be viewed by the delivery partner, preventing fraudulent misuse. Each order is assigned a unique blockchain chain, with the first block storing order details. The seller must choose a delivery partner through our integration with the marketplace and provide necessary details such as pick up location. This approach enforces tamper-proof tracking, ensuring authenticity while reducing fraudulent disputes. To optimize scalability, hashed proofs are stored on-chain, while full metadata is kept in off-chain storage. The system integrates proof-of-pickup mechanisms (QR codes, barcodes, or NFC scans) and optional customer verification steps to further strengthen trust. By leveraging Layer 2 rollups or permissioned blockchains, the solution can be scaled to be cost-effective and efficient, making it viable for widespread adoption across marketplaces and logistics networks.
